# Python-Public

**Python-Public** is a collection of Python scripts, modules, and sample projects, curated for learning, experimentation, and reference. This repository includes:

- **Algorithm Implementations:** Sorting (bubble, merge, quick, etc.), searching, and array manipulation.
- **Data Structures:** Custom array utilities, practice with lists, and more.
- **Mini Projects & Demos:** Games (like tic-tac-toe), charting, and AI experiments.
- **Utilities & Tools:** Logging, decorators, subprocess management, and system utilities.
- **Legacy & Reference Code:** Snapshots of early Python versions and CPython source for educational purposes.
- **Practice & Exercises:** A wide range of practice scripts for Python concepts, from basic to advanced.


## Directory Highlights

- `algoritms/` – Sorting (bubble, merge, quick, insert, random), searching, and graph algorithm scripts, organized by type (Sort, Search, Grapth).
- `arrays/` – Array utilities, NumPy experiments, and multi-dimensional array examples.
- `functions/` – Extensive function examples, error checking, data class demos, and small utilities.
- `modules/` – Modular code, including error checking, maze generators, and tic-tac-toe implementations.
- `Clean Up/` – Legacy, experimental, or refactored scripts and data files.
- `resources/images/` – Image assets for documentation or projects.
- Root scripts – Algorithm demos (binary search, sorting), system utilities, AI library tests, matplotlib and pandas practice, subprocess and timing utilities, and more.
